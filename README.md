> [!WARNING]
> **Early Development Stage!** Kaiku is currently an active work-in-progress and is **not yet ready for production usage**. Architecture, codebase, and features are subject to significant changes. 

## <span style="color: #88C0D0;">🐺 What is Kaiku?</span>

**Kaiku** (Finnish for *Echo*) is a modern, high-performance voice chat and Server-Centric overlay built specifically for gamers and esports teams who demand low-latency, reliable communication without system bloat. 

Echoing the quiet precision of the North, Kaiku ensures your pack stays connected, pulling inspiration from the sleek aesthetics of CachyOS Nordic combined with a robust WebRTC and Tauri-powered architecture.

## <span style="color: #88C0D0;">✨ Key Capabilities</span>

- ⚡ <b style="color: #B48EAD;">Low Latency Audio</b>: Optimized routing for immediate delivery of your callouts.
- 🛡️ <b style="color: #B48EAD;">Absolute Data Freedom</b>: Stop paying with your data. Self-hosted and End-to-End Encrypted so your team's strategy and conversations stay strictly yours.
- 💻 <b style="color: #B48EAD;">Minimal Resource Footprint</b>: Uses minimal CPU. Play your games without FPS drops or frame pacing issues.

## <span style="color: #88C0D0;">🖥️ Deploying Your Pack (Self-Hosting)</span>

Kaiku is designed from the ground up for **self-hosting**, giving you absolute sovereignty over your community's data and communication infrastructure. Unlike corporate alternatives that harvest your conversations, Kaiku ensures true freedom. Whether you are running a casual guild server or a massive esports organization, Kaiku scales with you.

👉 **[Read the Official Admin Guide](docs/admin-guide/self-hosting.md)** to learn how to deploy Kaiku using Docker, configure your TURN/STUN servers, and manage user access.

## <span style="color: #88C0D0;">🏗️ Architecture</span>

Built for maximum performance and minimum bloat:
- **Frontend**: Solid.js for extreme reactivity and a premium glassmorphic UI.
- **Backend/Desktop Integration**: Tauri (Rust) for native OS-level performance with a tiny memory footprint.
- **Audio Engine**: Fine-tuned WebRTC for flawless real-time communication.

👉 **[Explore the Architecture Overview](docs/developer-guide/architecture/architecture.md)**

## <span style="color: #88C0D0;">🔒 Security & Privacy</span>

We don't want your data. All direct messages and private group calls utilize **Olm cryptographic ratchet** (similar to Signal) for true end-to-end encryption. 

👉 **[Review our Security & Encryption Protocols](docs/developer-guide/security/security.md)**
