## File Upload Setup

### `init-minio.sh`

Initializes MinIO (S3-compatible storage) for local development.

**Prerequisites**: MinIO Client (`mc`) installed locally, or use Docker method (recommended).

**Usage**:

```bash
# Method 1: Via Docker (recommended - no local installation needed)
docker exec canis-dev-minio mc alias set local http://localhost:9000 minioadmin minioadmin
docker exec canis-dev-minio mc mb --ignore-existing local/voicechat
docker exec canis-dev-minio mc anonymous set none local/voicechat

# Method 2: Using the script (requires mc client)
./scripts/init-minio.sh
```

**What it does**:
1. Configures mc client to connect to local MinIO instance
2. Creates the `voicechat` bucket if it doesn't exist
3. Sets bucket policy to private (access via presigned URLs only)

**When to run**:
- First time setting up file uploads
- After running `docker compose down -v` (removes volumes)
- If file uploads return "Bucket not found" errors

See [File Uploads Development Guide](../docs/development/file-uploads.md) for complete setup instructions.
