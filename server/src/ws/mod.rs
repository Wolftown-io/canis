//! WebSocket Handler
//!
//! Real-time communication for chat and voice signaling.
//!
//! ## Authentication
//!
//! WebSocket authentication uses the `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol` header instead of
//! query parameters to avoid token exposure in logs, browser history, and referrer
//! headers.
//!
//! Client should connect with:
//! ```text
//! Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: access_token.<jwt_token>
//! ```
//!
//! Server responds with:
//! ```text
//! Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: access_token
//! ```
