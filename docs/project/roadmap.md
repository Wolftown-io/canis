  - Areas covered: Auth, Navigation, Messaging, Guild, Channels, Friends/DMs, Settings, Voice, Admin, Search, Permissions.
- [x] **[Infra] CI Pipeline Hardening & Green Build** ✅
  - All CI jobs passing: Rust Lint (fmt + clippy), Rust Tests, Frontend, License Compliance, Secrets Scan, Docker Build, Tauri (Ubuntu + macOS).

## Phase 6: Competitive Differentiators & Mastery
*Goal: Surpass industry leaders with unique utility and sovereignty features.*

- [ ] **[Client] Mobile Support**
  - Adapt Tauri frontend for mobile or begin Flutter/Native implementation.
- [ ] **[UX] Personal Workspaces (Favorites v2)**
  - **Context:** Solve "Discord Bloat" by letting users aggregate channels from disparate guilds.
  - **Strategy:** Allow users to create custom "Workspaces" that act as virtual folders. Users can drag-and-drop channels from any guild into these workspaces for a unified Mission Control view.
- [ ] **[Content] Sovereign Guild Model (BYO Infrastructure)**
  - **Context:** Provide ultimate data ownership for privacy-conscious groups.
  - **Strategy:** Allow Guild Admins in the SaaS version to provide their own **S3 API** keys and **SFU Relay** configurations, ensuring their media and voice traffic never touches Canis-owned storage.
- [ ] **[Voice] Live Session Toolkits**
  - **Context:** Turn voice channels into productive spaces.
  - **Strategy:** 
    - **Gaming/Raid Kit:** Multi-timer overlays and restricted side-notes for raid leads/shot-callers.
    - **Work/Task Kit:** Shared markdown notepad and collaborative "Action Item" tracking that auto-posts summaries to the channel post-session.
- [ ] **[UX] Context-Aware Focus Engine**
  - **Context:** Prevent platform fatigue with intelligent notification routing.
  - **Strategy:** Use Tauri's desktop APIs to detect active foreground apps (e.g., IDEs, DAWs). Implement **VIP/Emergency Overrides** that allow specific users or channels to bypass DND during focused work sessions.
- [ ] **[SaaS] The Digital Library (Wiki Mastery)**
  - **Context:** Transform "Information Pages" into a structured Knowledge Base.
  - **Strategy:** Enhance current Info Pages with version recovery, deep-linkable sections, and a "Library" view for long-term guild documentation.

---

## Phase 7: Long-term / Optional SaaS Polish
*Goal: Highly optional features aimed at commercial scale and enterprise utility.*

- [ ] **[SaaS] Billing & Subscription Infrastructure**
  - **Context:** Enable monetization for the managed hosting version.
  - **Strategy:** Integrate **Stripe** for subscription management. Create a `BillingService` to handle quotas, "Boost" payments, and tiered access levels.
- [ ] **[Compliance] Accessibility (A11y) & Mastery**
  - **Context:** Ensure the platform is usable by everyone and meets enterprise requirements.
  - **Strategy:** Conduct a full A11y audit. Implement WCAG compliance standards, screen-reader optimizations, and a robust Keyboard-Only navigation mode (`Cmd+K` Quick Switcher).
- [ ] **[SaaS] Identity Trust & OAuth Linking**
  - **Context:** Improve community trust and security.
  - **Strategy:** Allow users to link external accounts (GitHub, Discord, LinkedIn). Enable Guilds to set entrance requirements based on "Verified Identity" signals.
- [ ] **[Infra] SaaS Observability & Telemetry**
  - **Context:** Maintain uptime and catch bugs at scale.
  - **Strategy:** Integrate **Sentry** (error tracking) and **OpenTelemetry** for performance monitoring across the Rust backend and Tauri clients.

---

## Phase 10: SaaS Infrastructure at Scale
*Goal: Full SaaS-grade media delivery and CDN infrastructure.*

- [ ] **[Storage] SaaS Scaling Architecture**
  - Transition from Proxy Method to Signed URLs/Cookies.
  - CDN Integration with CloudFront/Cloudflare.
