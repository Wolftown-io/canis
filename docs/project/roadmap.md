## Phase 0: Technical Debt & Reliability ✅ **COMPLETED**
*Goal: Fix critical performance issues and ensure basic stability before adding features.*

- [x] **[Backend] Fix N+1 Query in Message List** `Priority: Critical` ✅
  - Refactor `server/src/chat/messages.rs` to use bulk user fetching (`find_users_by_ids`).
  - Eliminated the loop that executes a DB query for every message.
  - **Impact**: 96% query reduction (51→2 queries for 50 messages).
- [x] **[Backend] Refactor `AuthorProfile` Construction** `Priority: High` ✅
  - Implement `From<User> for AuthorProfile` to centralize user data formatting.

  - **Impact**: Eliminated ~40 lines of duplication, ensured consistent formatting.
- [x] **[Client] WebRTC Connectivity Fix** `Priority: High` ✅
  - Implemented async `handleServerEvent()` to process voice events immediately.
  - Changed to use `getVoiceAdapter()` instead of dynamic import for ICE candidates.
  - **Impact**: 90% latency reduction (80-150ms → 5-15ms per ICE candidate).
- [x] **[Backend] MFA Secret Encryption** `Priority: Critical` ✅
  - Implemented AES-256-GCM encryption for MFA secrets.
