- [x] **[Test] E2E UI Test Coverage Suite** ✅
  - Comprehensive Playwright E2E test suite covering 68 UI items across 12 spec files.
  - Shared test helpers (`e2e/helpers.ts`) with login, navigation, and utility functions.
  - Coverage tracking document (`docs/testing/ui-coverage.md`) mapping every UI item to its test.
  - First run: 8/68 passing without backend (auth form rendering); remaining 58 need running backend + seed data.
  - Areas covered: Auth, Navigation, Messaging, Guild, Channels, Friends/DMs, Settings, Voice, Admin, Search, Permissions.
- [x] **[Infra] CI Pipeline Hardening & Green Build** ✅
  - All CI jobs passing: Rust Lint (fmt + clippy), Rust Tests, Frontend, License Compliance, Secrets Scan, Docker Build, Tauri (Ubuntu + macOS).
  - Moved `@everyone` security test into `rust-test` job (was exhausting disk space in standalone Docker build).
  - Fixed Dockerfile shared crate paths and bumped Rust image to 1.88 for edition2024 support.
  - Added `icon.ico` to repo for Tauri deb bundling.

## Recent Changes

### 2026-02-26
- **Personal Workspaces** (PR #250) — Cross-guild channel aggregation with named workspace folders. 9 REST endpoints (CRUD, entry management, reordering), 7 WebSocket events for real-time sync, `workspaces` and `workspace_entries` tables with `update_updated_at()` triggers. Configurable limits via `MAX_WORKSPACES_PER_USER` (default 20) and `MAX_ENTRIES_PER_WORKSPACE` (default 50). Atomic CTE prevents limit bypass on concurrent requests. Guild membership + VIEW_CHANNEL permission checks enforced. 17 integration tests. Three code review rounds aligned error codes (SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE), status codes (403 for limits, 204 for reorder), structured tracing, validator crate usage, `Option<Option<String>>` icon clearing, and configurable entry limits.

### 2026-02-25
- **Phase 5 Complete** — All 17 Ecosystem & SaaS Readiness items delivered (str0m evaluation deferred as trigger-based). Phase 6 (Competitive Differentiators & Mastery) now in progress.
- **SaaS Trust & Data Governance** (PR #249) — GDPR-style data export and account deletion lifecycle. Users can request a full data export (profile, messages, guilds, friends, preferences) as a ZIP archive via `POST /api/me/data-export`; background worker gathers data, uploads to S3, and sends email notification when ready (7-day expiry). Account deletion via `POST /api/me/delete-account` with password verification and 30-day grace period; cancellation via `POST /api/me/delete-account/cancel`. Guild ownership must be transferred first. After grace period, hourly worker permanently deletes the user with messages anonymized (author removed via SET NULL FK). Database migration adds `data_export_jobs` table, user deletion columns, and fixes 13 bare FK constraints. New `DataGovernance` rate limit category (2 req/60s). 11 integration tests. Two code review rounds addressed AuthUser test compilation, cancel_deletion rate limit scope, email template, and comment accuracy.
- **Advanced Media Processing** (PR #248) — Progressive image loading with blurhash placeholders, thumbnail (256px) and medium (1024px) WebP variant generation, aspect-ratio CSS to prevent layout shift, and variant download endpoint with graceful fallback.

### 2026-02-24
- **Guild Resource Limits & Usage Stats** (PR #247) — Configurable per-instance resource limits enforced server-side at 8 code points (guild creation, member join via invite/discovery, channel/role/emoji/bot/webhook creation) with `LIMIT_EXCEEDED` (403) errors. Limits loaded from environment variables with sensible defaults, clamped to >= 1. New endpoints: `GET /api/guilds/{id}/usage` (member-only usage stats with parallel count queries via `tokio::join!`) and `GET /api/config/limits` (public instance limits). Database migration adds `plan` column to guilds (default: "free") for future tier/boost system. Frontend Usage tab in guild settings with progress bars and color-coded thresholds (green <70%, yellow 70-90%, red >90%). 10 integration tests. Two code review rounds addressed TOCTOU race on invite join (switched to `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`), config validation (`.max(1)` clamp), and missing test coverage (emoji limit, discovery join limit).
- **Guild Discovery & Onboarding Wizard** (PRs #244, #245, #246) — Three stacked PRs delivering guild discovery backend, frontend UI, and onboarding wizard. Backend: PostgreSQL migration with `discoverable`, `tags`, `banner_url` columns, full-text `search_vector` (tsvector), denormalized `member_count` with trigger, public browse/join API with rate limiting and WebSocket broadcast, server config flag. Frontend: `DiscoveryView` with search/sort/pagination, `GuildCard` with banner/tags/join, Compass icon in ServerRail, guild settings extension (discoverable toggle, tags editor, banner URL). Onboarding: 5-step wizard (Welcome → Theme → Mic Setup → Join Server → Done), extracted `MicTestPanel`, ARIA-compliant tabs with focus trap, re-triggerable from settings. Seven code review rounds addressed 40+ issues including denormalized queries, case-insensitive tags, past-end pagination, focus trap, `createUniqueId()` for element IDs, parent-level joined tracking, and AudioContext error handling.

### 2026-02-19
- **Advanced Moderation & Safety Filters** (PR #206) — Guild-configurable content filters with Aho-Corasick + regex hybrid engine. Built-in categories (slurs, hate speech, spam, abusive language) with Block/Log/Warn actions. Custom guild patterns with ReDoS protection. Per-guild cached `FilterEngine` with generation-counter invalidation. Integrated into message create/edit/upload flows (skips encrypted and DM messages). Frontend Safety tab with category toggles, custom pattern CRUD, test panel, and moderation log. 17 integration tests + 9 unit tests. Two code review rounds addressed 12 issues including TOCTOU race fix, transactional upserts, regex validation three-way match, and ephemeral test engine.
- **Tech Debt Cleanup** (branch `chore/tech-debt`) — Resolved 16 of 30 cataloged tech debt items across server, client, and shared crates:
  - **Security:** Gated megolm E2EE stubs behind feature flag (TD-01), replaced WebSocket `.expect()` panics with proper error responses (TD-05), added search query length validation (TD-08)
  - **Features:** MFA backup codes with Argon2id hashing (TD-06), E2EE backups now include real keys (TD-04), admin elevation detection fixed (TD-17), spoiler reveal persistence (TD-22), window focus check for notifications (TD-20)

  - **Testing:** 10 new search security/edge-case integration tests (TD-08), search analytics logging (TD-30)
  - **Already done:** Channel permission filtering (TD-02) and upload limit sync (TD-13) were found to be already implemented

### 2026-02-13
- **E2E UI Test Coverage Suite** - Created comprehensive Playwright test suite with 68 UI items across 12 spec files (10 new + 2 pre-existing). Shared helpers (`e2e/helpers.ts`) for login, navigation, and utilities. Coverage tracker at `docs/testing/ui-coverage.md`. First run: 8 passing (auth form rendering), 58 need backend, 3 not coverable. Test areas: Auth (12 items), Navigation (9), Messaging (5), Guild (5), Channels (4), Friends/DMs (5), Settings (8), Voice (6), Admin (6), Search (3), Permissions (5).

Extracted all inline SQL into reusable helpers (`create_guild`, `create_channel`, `insert_message`, `insert_message_at`, `insert_encrypted_message`, `insert_deleted_message`, `insert_attachment`, `add_guild_member`, `delete_guild`, `delete_dm_channel`). Updated roadmap search checklist.

### 2026-01-31
- **Toast Component Tests** - Created comprehensive test suite for toast notification system (16 passing tests, 5 skipped timing tests). Tests verify API behavior including deduplication, max visible limit (5), dismissal, and toast types. Added duration: 0 workaround for vitest window.setTimeout issues.
- **Tauri WebSocket Event Parity Phase 1** (Issue #132) - Added 11 ServerEvent variants to Rust backend: Call events (IncomingCall, CallStarted, CallEnded, CallParticipantJoined, CallParticipantLeft, CallDeclined), Read sync (ChannelRead, DmRead, DmNameUpdated), and Reactions (ReactionAdd, ReactionRemove). Added corresponding Tauri event listeners in frontend. Progress: 11/22 events completed.
