## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance

| Metric | Target | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Voice Latency | <50ms | End-to-end |
| Client RAM | <100MB | Idle |
| Client CPU | <1% | Idle |
| Server: 100 Users | 4 vCPU, 8GB RAM | Concurrent in voice |
| Client Startup Time | <3s | Until usable |

### Scaling

| Scenario | Support | Notes |
|----------|---------|-------|
| 10-100 Users (normal) | ✅ Single Node | Standard deployment |
| 100-500 Users (peak) | ✅ Single Node | More hardware |
| 500-1000+ Users | ⚠️ Cluster | Horizontal SFU scaling needed |

**Decision:** MVP focuses on single-node up to 100 users. Architecture allows later scaling.

### Security

| Session Management | Opaque tokens + Redis |
| MFA | TOTP (RFC 6238) |

### Availability

| Requirement | Target |
|-------------|--------|
| Uptime | 99.9% (self-hosted depends on operator) |
| Backup Interval | Daily automatic |
| Recovery Time | <30 minutes from backup |
| Graceful Degradation | Text chat works during voice outage |

## Decision Log

### E-001: Encryption Strategy

**Date:** 2024
**Status:** Decided

**Context:** Selection of encryption method for voice and text.

**Options:**
1. DTLS-SRTP + Signal Protocol
2. SFrame + Signal Protocol
3. MLS for both
4. Mesh/P2P

**Decision:**
- MVP: DTLS-SRTP (Voice) + Olm/Megolm via vodozemac (Text)
- Later optional: MLS for "Paranoid Mode"

**Rationale:**
- Minimal development effort for MVP
- Self-hosted = server is trusted
- vodozemac instead of libsignal due to AGPL license issue
- MLS architecture prepared for later upgrade

---

### E-002: SSO Handling

**Date:** 2024
**Status:** Decided

**Context:** Integration of local users and SSO users.

**Decision:** "Unified Identity with Local Profile"
- JIT (Just-in-Time) provisioning for SSO users
- All users have local profile in the system
- Configurable attribute mapping
- Optional: Identity linking (local ↔ SSO)

**Rationale:**
- Unified user handling in the system
- Flexibility for different SSO providers
- No manual user creation needed

---

### E-003: Client Framework

**Date:** 2024
**Status:** Decided

**Context:** Selection of framework for desktop clients.

**Options:**
1. Electron
2. Tauri
3. Flutter Desktop
4. Native (Qt, GTK)

**Decision:** Tauri 2.0

**Rationale:**
- Significantly lower RAM usage than Electron (~80MB vs ~300MB)
- Rust backend fits the server stack
- Native noise cancellation possible
- Cross-platform with one codebase
- MIT/Apache 2.0 licensed

---

### E-004: Project License

**Date:** 2024
**Status:** Decided

**Context:** Choice of open-source license for the project.

**Options:**
1. MIT
2. Apache 2.0
3. MIT OR Apache 2.0 (Dual)
4. GPL 3.0
5. AGPL 3.0

**Decision:** MIT OR Apache-2.0 (Dual License)

**Rationale:**
- Maximum compatibility
- Standard in the Rust ecosystem
- Allows commercial use and SaaS
- Patent protection through Apache option
- No copyleft restrictions

---

### E-005: Text E2EE Library

**Date:** 2024
**Status:** Decided

**Context:** libsignal is AGPL-licensed, which would force project license.

**Options:**
1. libsignal (AGPL 3.0)
2. vodozemac (Apache 2.0)
3. Custom implementation
4. OpenMLS (MIT)

**Decision:** vodozemac

**Rationale:**
- Apache 2.0 compatible with project license
- Implements Olm (1:1) and Megolm (groups)
- Production-tested by Matrix/Element
- Pure Rust, no C dependencies
- Double Ratchet with Perfect Forward Secrecy

---

### E-006: Scaling Strategy

**Date:** 2024
**Status:** Decided

**Context:** Design for different user counts.

**Decision:**
- Phase 1 (MVP): Single-node with channel limits (50-100 per voice)
- Phase 2 (if needed): Horizontal SFU scaling

**Rationale:**
- 99% of use cases covered with single-node
- No over-engineering for MVP
- Architecture allows later upgrade
