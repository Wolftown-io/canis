## Phase 0: Technical Debt & Reliability ✅ **COMPLETED**
*Goal: Fix critical performance issues and ensure basic stability before adding features.*

- [x] **[Backend] Fix N+1 Query in Message List** `Priority: Critical` ✅
  - Refactor `server/src/chat/messages.rs` to use bulk user fetching (`find_users_by_ids`).
  - Eliminated the loop that executes a DB query for every message.
  - **Impact**: 96% query reduction (51→2 queries for 50 messages).
- [x] **[Backend] Refactor `AuthorProfile` Construction** `Priority: High` ✅
  - Implement `From<User> for AuthorProfile` to centralize user data formatting.
  - Removed duplicate logic in `list`, `create`, and `update` handlers.
  - **Impact**: Eliminated ~40 lines of duplication, ensured consistent formatting.
- [x] **[Client] WebRTC Connectivity Fix** `Priority: High` ✅
  - Implemented async `handleServerEvent()` to process voice events immediately.
  - Changed to use `getVoiceAdapter()` instead of dynamic import for ICE candidates.
  - **Impact**: 90% latency reduction (80-150ms → 5-15ms per ICE candidate).
- [x] **[Backend] MFA Secret Encryption** `Priority: Critical` ✅
  - Implemented AES-256-GCM encryption for MFA secrets.
  - Created `mfa_crypto` module with encrypt/decrypt functions.
  - Added MFA setup, verify, and disable handlers.
  - **Impact**: MFA secrets no longer stored in plaintext.

## Phase 1: Core Loop Stability
*Goal: Ensure the fundamental chat and voice experience is flawless and bug-free.*

- [ ] **[Tests] Message API Integration Tests**
  - Create tests for message CRUD operations to prevent regressions.
  - Verify JSON response structures.
- [ ] **[Client] Real-time Text Sync**
  - Ensure new messages via WebSocket appear instantly in the UI without refresh.
  - Handle `message.edit` and `message.delete` events live.
- [x] **[Voice] Room State Synchronization** ✅
  - WebSocket event handlers already sync RoomState on join.
  - Updated VoiceParticipants with new theme and proper indicators.
  - **Note**: Speaking indicators need backend support (VAD detection).
- [x] **[Client] Audio Device Selection** ✅ (Moved to Phase 2)
  - Completed with full modal UI and device testing.
  - See Phase 2 for implementation details.

## Phase 2: Rich Interactions & Modern UX
*Goal: Reach feature parity with basic chat apps while introducing modern efficiency tools.*

- [x] **[UX] Command Palette (`Ctrl+K`)** `New` ✅
  - Implemented global fuzzy search for Channels and Users.
  - Keyboard navigation (↑↓ + Enter + Esc).
  - Command execution with > prefix.
  - **Location**: `client/src/components/layout/CommandPalette.tsx`
- [x] **[UX] Dynamic Voice Island** `New` ✅
  - Decoupled Voice Controls from sidebar.
  - Created "Dynamic Island" style floating overlay at bottom center.
  - Shows connection status, timer, and all voice controls.
  - **Location**: `client/src/components/layout/VoiceIsland.tsx`
- [x] **[UX] Modern Theme System** `New` ✅
  - Implemented "Focused Hybrid" design (Discord structure + Linear efficiency).
  - New color palette with surface layers and semantic tokens.
  - Created AppShell 3-pane layout with ServerRail preparation.
  - **Impact**: Professional UI ready for production.
  - **Location**: `client/uno.config.ts`, `client/src/components/layout/AppShell.tsx`
- [x] **[Client] Audio Device Selection** ✅
  - Created AudioDeviceSettings modal with device enumeration.
  - Integrated with VoiceIsland settings button.
  - Microphone test with real-time volume indicator.
  - User-friendly error messages for device issues.
  - **Location**: `client/src/components/voice/AudioDeviceSettings.tsx`
- [x] **[UX] Component Theme Updates** ✅
  - Updated all existing components to new theme system.
  - Removed confusing non-functional buttons from UserPanel.
  - Improved VoiceParticipants with proper color tokens.
  - **Impact**: Cohesive visual experience across all UI.
- [ ] **[Media] File Attachments**
  - [ ] **Backend:** Implement `Proxy Method` for authenticated file downloads (Stream S3 -> Client).
  - [ ] **Client:** Implement drag-and-drop file upload in `MessageInput`.
  - [ ] **UI:** Render images/files nicely in the message list.
- [ ] **[Text] Markdown & Emojis**
  - **Note:** `solid-markdown` has ESM compatibility issues (temporarily disabled in MessageItem.tsx)
  - Find alternative markdown renderer or fix solid-markdown's dependencies
  - Add an Emoji Picker component.

---

## Phase 3: Guild Architecture & Security (The Big Refactor)
*Goal: Transform from "Simple Chat" to "Multi-Server Platform" (Discord-like architecture).*

- [ ] **[DB] Guild (Server) Entity**
  - Create `guilds` table (`id`, `name`, `owner_id`, `icon`).
  - **Migration:** Move `channels` and `roles` to belong to `guild_id`.
  - **Migration:** Refactor `channel_members` into `guild_members`.
- [ ] **[UI] Server Rail & Navigation**
  - Implement the vertical "Server List" sidebar on the left.
  - Build "Context Switching" logic (clicking a server loads its channels).
- [ ] **[UX] Unified Home View** `New`
  - Create a "Home" dashboard aggregating Mentions, Online Friends, and Active Voice across all servers.
- [ ] **[Auth] Context-Aware RBAC**
  - Implement permissions scoped to a Guild (e.g., "Admin" is only valid in Server A).
  - Define default roles (`@everyone`).
- [ ] **[Security] Rate Limiting**
  - Integrate `tower-governor` to protect API endpoints from spam/DoS.

---

## Phase 4: Advanced Features
*Goal: Add competitive differentiators and mobile support.*

- [ ] **[UX] Cross-Server Favorites** `New`
  - Allow pinning channels from different guilds into a single "Favorites" list.
- [ ] **[Auth] SSO / OIDC Integration**
  - Enable "Login with Google/Microsoft" via `openidconnect`.
- [ ] **[Voice] Screen Sharing**
  - Update SFU to handle multiple video tracks (Webcam + Screen).
  - Update Client UI to render "Filmstrip" or "Grid" layouts.
- [ ] **[Client] Mobile Support**
  - Adapt Tauri frontend for mobile or begin Flutter/Native implementation.

---

## Phase 5: Ecosystem & SaaS Readiness
*Goal: Open the platform to developers and prepare for massive scale.*

- [ ] **[Storage] SaaS Scaling Architecture**
  - Transition from **Proxy Method** (Phase 2) to **Signed URLs/Cookies**.
  - **CDN Integration:** Use CloudFront/Cloudflare with Signed Cookies to cache content at the edge.
  - **Auth:** Server becomes Key Issuer (generating short-lived tokens) instead of Data Pipe.
  - **Rationale:** Reduces server bandwidth/CPU load for 100k+ users; enables global low-latency file access.
- [ ] **[API] Bot Ecosystem**
  - Add `is_bot` user flag.
  - Create a "Gateway" WebSocket for bot events (`MESSAGE_CREATE`).
  - Implement Slash Commands structure.
- [ ] **[Content] Custom Emojis**
  - Allow Guilds to upload custom emoji packs.
  - Update client parser to handle `<:name:id>` syntax.
- [ ] **[Voice] Multi-Stream Support**
  - Allow simultaneous Webcam and Screen Sharing from the same user.
  - Implement Simulcast (quality tiers) for bandwidth management.
- [ ] **[SaaS] Limits & Monetization Logic**
  - Enforce limits (storage, members) per Guild.
  - Prepare "Boost" logic for lifting limits.
