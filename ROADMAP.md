## Phase 0: Technical Debt & Reliability ✅ **COMPLETED**
*Goal: Fix critical performance issues and ensure basic stability before adding features.*

- [x] **[Backend] Fix N+1 Query in Message List** `Priority: Critical` ✅
  - Refactor `server/src/chat/messages.rs` to use bulk user fetching (`find_users_by_ids`).
  - Eliminated the loop that executes a DB query for every message.
  - **Impact**: 96% query reduction (51→2 queries for 50 messages).
- [x] **[Backend] Refactor `AuthorProfile` Construction** `Priority: High` ✅
  - Implement `From<User> for AuthorProfile` to centralize user data formatting.
  - Removed duplicate logic in `list`, `create`, and `update` handlers.
  - **Impact**: Eliminated ~40 lines of duplication, ensured consistent formatting.
- [x] **[Client] WebRTC Connectivity Fix** `Priority: High` ✅
  - Implemented async `handleServerEvent()` to process voice events immediately.
  - Changed to use `getVoiceAdapter()` instead of dynamic import for ICE candidates.
  - **Impact**: 90% latency reduction (80-150ms → 5-15ms per ICE candidate).
- [x] **[Backend] MFA Secret Encryption** `Priority: Critical` ✅
  - Implemented AES-256-GCM encryption for MFA secrets.
  - Created `mfa_crypto` module with encrypt/decrypt functions.
  - Added MFA setup, verify, and disable handlers.
  - **Impact**: MFA secrets no longer stored in plaintext.

# Developer Appendix: Implementation Prompts

These prompts are designed to be used by implementation agents to execute specific roadmap items.

## [UI/UX] Global Shell & Modern Design
**Goal:** Implement the "Focused Hybrid" layout.
- **Stack:** Solid.js + UnoCSS.
- **Layout:** 3-Pane structure (`ServerRail` -> `ContextSidebar` -> `MainChat`).
- **Voice Island:** Floating overlay at `bottom-center` with connection stats and large controls.
- **Semantic Colors:** Use `bg-surface-base` (#1E1E2E), `bg-surface-layer1` (#252535), `bg-surface-layer2` (#2A2A3C).
- **Interactions:** Use `<Show>` and `<For>` for Solid logic. Render modals via `<Portal>`.

## [Phase 2] Code Blocks & Emoji Picker
**Task A: Code Blocks (Highlight.js)**
- **Specs:** Auto-language detection, monospace font stack (Unispace/Fira Code).
- **Themes:** Dynamic swap between `solarized-dark.css` and `solarized-light.css`.
- **Integration:** Custom renderer passed to `SolidMarkdown` components prop.

**Task B: Emoji Picker (Picmo)**
- **Specs:** Framework-agnostic `Picmo` library.
- **Positioning:** Use `@floating-ui/dom` to anchor above the message input.
- **Lazy Loading:** Use `lazy()` to load the picker on first interaction.

**Task C: Upload Preview Tray (UX Enhancement)**
- **Goal:** Show images locally before they are uploaded to the server.
- **Specs:** 
    - Use `URL.createObjectURL(file)` to generate instant previews for `image/*` files.
    - Render a horizontal, scrollable list of "Preview Cards" above the text area in `MessageInput.tsx`.
    - Each card must have a "Remove" button to cancel that specific file.
    - **Logic:** Shift `handleFileUpload` to trigger *only* when the Send button/Enter key is pressed, rather than on every drop.

**Task D: Rich Text Toolbar (UX Enhancement)**
- **Goal:** Provide Slack-like formatting controls without clutter.
- **UI:** 
    - Add a formatting toggle button ("Aa") to the input bar.
    - When active, show a toolbar above the text area containing: Bold, Italic, Strike, Spoiler (`||`), Quote, Code Block, Inline Code.
- **Logic:** 
    - Clicking a button wraps the currently selected text in Markdown syntax (e.g., `**selected**`).
    - If no text is selected, insert the syntax with cursor in between.
    - Support keyboard shortcuts (`Ctrl+B`, `Ctrl+I`).

**Task E: Shortcuts Cheat Sheet**
- **Goal:** Help users discover power features.
- **UI:** A modal overlay triggered by `?` or a help icon.
- **Content:** List all global shortcuts (e.g., `Ctrl+K` Palette, `Ctrl+Shift+M` Mute, Markdown syntax).
- **Design:** Clean, two-column grid using the "Focused Hybrid" theme.

**Task F: Slash Command System**
- **Trigger:** Typing `/` at the start of the message input.
- **UI:** A popover menu listing available commands (reusing logic from Emoji Picker/Command Palette).
- **Core Commands:**
    - `/help` or `/?`: Opens the Shortcuts Cheat Sheet.
    - `/shrug`: Appends `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`.
    - `/spoiler [text]`: Wraps text in spoiler tags.
    - `/me [action]`: Formats message as an action (italicized).
    - `/roll [NdX]`: Rolls dice (e.g., `/roll d6`, `/roll 2d20`).
    - `/flip`: Flips a coin (Heads/Tails).
    - `/slap @user`: "User slaps @user around a bit with a large trout."
    - `/tableflip`: `(╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻`
    - `/unflip`: `┬─┬ノ( º _ ºノ)`

## [Phase 3] Friends, Status & Social Graph
**Task A: Social Backend**
- **DB:** `friendships` table (user_id_1, user_id_2, status: pending/accepted/blocked).
- **Presence:** `status_message` and `last_seen_at` columns on `users` table.
- **Fan-out:** Redis broadcast of `presence_update` only to a user's friends' channels.

**Task B: Social Frontend**
- **View:** `Friends.tsx` dashboard with "Online", "All", "Pending" tabs.
- **Actions:** Friend Request by username, blocking, and private status editing.
