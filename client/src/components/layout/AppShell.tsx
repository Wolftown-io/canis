 * AppShell - Main Layout Grid

 * The primary layout structure for Canis.

 * Discord structure + Linear/Arc efficiency.

 * Layout Structure:
 * 1. Server Rail (72px) - Leftmost vertical bar for server/guild navigation
 * 2. Context Sidebar (240px) - Channel list and user panel
 * 3. Main Stage (flex-1) - Chat messages and content
 * 4. Voice Island (overlay) - Floating voice controls
